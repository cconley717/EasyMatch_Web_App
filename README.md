# EasyMatch_Web_App

A final class project from my final quarter at UCSD. For this project I decided to make a responsive single-page online dating web app, built with college students and mobile devices in mind. 

The web app makes use of the Google Firebase cloud platform, specifically their web hosting, file storage, and database features. The browser client uses Google Firebase's JavaScript SDK. I have included two writeup files in the repo that give an in-depth look into the construction of the web-app. Additionally, it also uses Bootstrap and jQuery.
